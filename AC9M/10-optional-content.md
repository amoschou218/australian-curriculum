# Optional content for post-year 10 Mathematics pathways

## Number

operations on numbers involving fractional exponents and surds

simplification of combinations of linear expressions with rational coefficients and the solution of related equations

algebraic representations of quadratic functions of the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are non-zero integers, and their transformation to the form $f(x) = a(x+h)^2 + k$ where $h$ and $k$  are non-zero rational numbers, and the solution of related equations

the graphs of $y = sin x$ and $y = cos x$ as functions of a real variable and the solution of related equations

the inverse relationship between exponential functions and logarithmic functions and the solution of related equations

## Measurement

the effect of increasingly small changes in the value of variables on the average rate of change and in relation to limiting values

## Space

relationships between angles and various lines associated with circles (radii, diameters, chords, tangents)

## Statistics

measures of spread, their interpretation and usefulness with respect to different data distributions

## Probability

counting principles, and factorial notation as a representation that provides efficient counting in multiplicative contexts, including calculations of probabilities
