# Level description: Year 8

In Year 8, learning in Mathematics builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.

Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:
* extend computation with combinations of the 4 operations with integers and positive rational numbers, recognise the relationship between fractions and their terminating or infinite recurring decimal expansions; they convert between fraction and decimal forms of rational numbers and locate them on the real number line
* extend the exponent laws to numerical calculations involving positive and zero exponents, and solve a broad range of practical problems, using mental methods, written algorithms and digital tools
* use mathematical modelling to solve problems in a broad range of contexts that involve ratios with 2 or more terms, percentage increase and decrease, proportions with decimal values, and rates in measurement contexts, and apply proportional reasoning
* manipulate linear and other algebraic expressions, recognise and model situations using linear relations and solve related equations using tables, graphs and algebra
* interpret and explain demonstrations and proofs of Pythagoras’ theorem and investigate irrational numbers, their infinite non-recurring decimal expansion and their approximate location on the real number line
* select metric measurement units fit for purpose, convert between units, recognising the effects of different levels of measurement accuracy on the results of computations, and relate these to interval estimates for measurements in various contexts
* apply knowledge of the relationships between π and the features of circles to solve problems involving circumference and area and establish sets of congruency and similarity conditions for common shapes in the plane and create algorithms to test for these conditions, discuss examples and counterexamples
* construct and locate objects with reference to three dimensional coordinates using digital tools
* consider a variety of situations involving complementary and mutually exclusive events, combinations of 2 events; represent these using tables and diagrams, conducting simulations and calculating corresponding probabilities
* examine experimental and observational data and identify populations and samples with respect to context; investigate variation in summary statistics across samples of varying size and discuss their findings.
