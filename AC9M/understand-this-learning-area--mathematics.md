## Mathematics

### Introduction

The Australian Curriculum: Mathematics has been developed on the basis that all students will study Mathematics in each year of schooling from Foundation to Year 10.

### Rationale

The study of mathematics is central to the learning, development and prospects of all young Australians. Mathematics provides students with essential mathematical knowledge, skills, procedures and processes in number, algebra, measurement, space, statistics and probability. It develops the numeracy capabilities that all students need in their personal, work and civic lives, and provides the fundamentals on which mathematical specialties and professional applications of mathematics are built.

Mathematics has its own value and aesthetic, and the Mathematics curriculum develops students’ appreciation of the power of mathematical reasoning as they develop mastery of the content in mathematics. It provides students with learning opportunities to develop mathematical proficiency, including a sound understanding of and fluency with the concepts, skills, procedures and processes needed to interpret contexts, choose ways to approach situations using mathematics, and to reason and solve problems arising from these situations. The curriculum clarifies the links between the various aspects of mathematics as well as the relationship between mathematics and other disciplines.

Mathematical ideas have evolved across cultures over thousands of years and are continually developing. The modern world is influenced by ever expanding computational power, digital systems, automation, artificial intelligence, economics and a data driven society. This leads to the need for a capable Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. Mathematics is integral to quantifying, thinking critically and making sense of the world. It is central to building students’ pattern recognition, visualisation, spatial reasoning and logical thinking. Interdisciplinary STEM learning can enhance students’ scientific and mathematical literacy, design and computational thinking, problem-solving and collaboration skills. Developing these competencies supports students in pursuing a variety of careers and occupations within STEM and other fields.

Mathematics provides opportunities for students to apply their mathematical understanding creatively and efficiently. It enables teachers to help students become self-motivated, confident learners through practice, inquiry, and active participation in relevant and challenging experiences.

### Aims

Mathematics aims to ensure that students:  
* become confident, proficient and effective users and communicators of mathematics, who can investigate, represent and interpret situations in their personal and work lives, think critically, and make choices as active, engaged, numerate citizens
* develop proficiency with mathematical concepts, skills, procedures and processes, and use them to demonstrate mastery in mathematics as they pose and solve problems, and reason with number, algebra, measurement, space, statistics and probability
* make connections between areas of mathematics and apply mathematics to model situations in various fields and disciplines
* foster a positive disposition towards mathematics, recognising it as an accessible and useful discipline to study
* acquire specialist mathematical knowledge and skills that underpin numeracy development and lead to further study in mathematics and other disciplines.

### Structure

Mathematics is presented in year levels for each year from Foundation to Year 10. Content is organised under 6 interrelated strands:
* Number
* Algebra
* Measurement
* Space
* Statistics
* Probability.

The strands are illustrated in Figure 1.

An expectation of mathematical proficiency has been embedded into curriculum content across all strands to ensure that students develop mastery in mathematics through the development and application of increasingly sophisticated and refined mathematical understanding and fluency, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. The concepts, skills, procedures and processes essential to the learning of mathematics are organised under 6 interrelated strands, in a sequence of development that increases in depth and breadth across the years of schooling.

Natural connections exist between the content of these strands; for example, *Number and Algebra* build on an understanding of number systems and the properties of operations to describe relationships and formulate generalisations. *Statistics and Probability* have strong connections that rely on and build upon the important links between them. *Measurement* relates not only to *Space* but is foundational to all strands, enhancing their practical relevance. Combined with *Number*, it provides a means to quantify, compare, communicate and make meaning of situations. It is important that students develop the capability to identify and use the many connections that exist within and across the strands of Mathematics.

The 6 content strands also specify content aimed at progressively developing students’ knowledge and use of mathematical, statistical and computational thinking through the processes of mathematical modelling, computational thinking, statistical investigation, probability experiments and simulations. When students are actively engaged in learning experiences involving the mathematical processes, they draw upon and further develop their mathematical understanding, fluency, reasoning and problem-solving skills in an integrated way.

#### Strands

##### Number

The *Number* strand develops ways of working with mental constructs that deal with correspondence, magnitude and order, for which operations and their properties can be defined. Numbers have wide ranging application and specific uses in counting, measuring and other means of quantifying situations and objects. Number systems are constructed to deal with different contexts and problems involving finite and infinite, discrete and continuous sets. Developing number sense and the ability to work effectively with numbers is critical to being an active and productive citizen who is successful at work and in future learning, who is financially literate, and who engages with the world and other individuals. 

##### Algebra

The *Algebra* strand develops ways of using symbols and symbolic representations to think and reason about relationships in both mathematical and real-world contexts. It provides a means for manipulating mathematical objects, recognising patterns and structures, making connections, understanding properties of operations and the concept of equivalence, abstracting information, working with variables, solving equations and generalising number and operation facts and relationships. Algebra connects symbolic, graphic and numeric representations. It deals with situations of generality, communicating abstract ideas applied in areas such as science, health, finance, sports, engineering, and building and construction.  

##### Measurement

The *Measurement* strand develops ways of quantifying aspects of the human and physical world. Measures and units are defined and selected to be relevant and appropriate to the context. Measurement is used to answer questions, show results, demonstrate value, justify allocation of resources, evaluate performance, identify opportunities for improvement and manage results. Measurement underpins understanding, comparison and decision-making in many personal, societal, environmental, agricultural, industrial, health and economic contexts. 

##### Space

The *Space* strand develops ways of visualising, representing and working with the location, direction, shape, placement, proximity and transformation of objects at macro, local and micro scales in natural and constructed worlds. It underpins the capacity to make pictures, diagrams, maps, projections, networks, models and graphics that enable the manipulation and analysis of shapes and objects through actions and the senses. This includes notions such as surface, region, boundary, curve, object, dimension, connectedness, symmetry, direction, congruence and similarity. These notions apply to art, design, architecture, planning, transportation, construction and manufacturing, physics, engineering, chemistry, biology and medicine.

##### Statistics

The *Statistics* strand develops ways of collecting understanding and describing data and its distribution. Statistics provide a story, or means to support or question an argument, and enables exploratory data analysis that underpins decision-making and informed judgement. Statistical literacy requires an understanding of statistical information and processes, including an awareness of data and the ability to estimate, interpret, evaluate and communicate with respect to variation in the real world. Statistical literacy provides a basis for critical scrutiny of an argument, the accuracy of representations, and the validity and reliability of inferences and claims. The effective use of data requires acknowledging and expecting variation in the collection, analysis and interpretation of categorical and numerical variables. Statistics is used in business, government, research, sport, healthcare and media for critical and informed evaluation of issues, arguments and decision-making.

##### Probability

The *Probability* strand develops ways of dealing with uncertainty and expectation, making predictions, and characterising the chance of events, or how likely events are to occur from both empirical and theoretical bases. It provides a means of considering, analysing and utilising the chance of events, and recognising random phenomena for which it is impossible to exactly determine the next observed outcome before it occurs. In contexts where chance plays a role, probability provides experimental and theoretical ways to quantify how likely it is that a particular outcome will occur or a proposition is the case. This enables students to understand contexts involving chance and to build mathematical models surrounding risk and decision-making in a range of areas of human endeavour. These include finance, science, business management, epidemiology, games of chance, computer science and artificial intelligence.
