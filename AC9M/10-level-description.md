# Level description: Year 10

In Year 10, learning in Mathematics builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.

Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:
*investigate the accuracy of decimal approximations to irrational real numbers; consider the accuracy of computation with real numbers in context and the use of logarithmic scales to deal with phenomena involving small and large quantities and change
*apply numerical, graphical and algebraic approaches to analyse the behaviour of pairs of linear equations and linear inequalities in 2 variables
*generalise and extend their repertoire of algebraic techniques involving quadratic and exponential algebraic expressions
*use mathematical modelling to solve problems in applied situations exhibiting growth or decay using linear, quadratic and exponential functions; and solve related equations, numerically, graphically and algebraically, with the use of digital tools as applicable
*solve measurement problems involving the surface area and volume of common objects, composite objects and irregular objects; use Pythagoras’ theorem and trigonometry of right-angled triangles to solve spatial problems in two- and three-dimensions, and manipulate images of their representations using digital tools
*apply geometric theorems to deduce results and solve problems involving plane shapes, and interpret networks and network diagrams in authentic contexts
*investigate conditional probability and its relation to dependent and independent events, including sampling with and without replacement; devise and use simulations to test intuitions involving chance events that may or may not be independent
*compare different ways of representing the distribution of continuous data and interpret key features of the distribution; explore association between pairs of variables, decide the form of representation, interpret the data with respect to the context and discuss possible conclusions; use scatterplots to informally discuss and consider association between 2 numerical variables and informally consider lines of good fit by eye, interpolation, extrapolation and limitations.
