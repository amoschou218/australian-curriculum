AC9MAS7A0|A0|By the end of Year 7,
AC9MAS7A1|A1|Students represent natural numbers in expanded form and as products of prime factors, using exponent notation.
AC9MAS7A2|A2|They solve problems involving squares of numbers and square roots of perfect square numbers.
AC9MAS7A3|A3|Students solve problems involving addition and subtraction of integers.
AC9MAS7A4|A4|They use all 4 operations in calculations involving positive fractions and decimals, choosing efficient calculation strategies.
AC9MAS7A5|A5|Students choose between equivalent representations of rational numbers and percentages to assist in calculations.
AC9MAS7A6|A6|They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving rational numbers, percentages and ratios, in financial and other applied contexts, justifying choices of representation.
AC9MAS7A7|A7|Students use algebraic expressions to represent situations, describe the relationships between variables from authentic data and substitute values into formulas to determine unknown values.
AC9MAS7A8|A8|They solve linear equations with natural number solutions.
AC9MAS7A9|A9|Students create tables of values related to algebraic expressions and formulas, and describe the effect of variation.
AC9MAS7B1|B1|They apply knowledge of angle relationships and the sum of angles in a triangle to solve problems, giving reasons.
AC9MAS7B2|B2|Students use formulas for the areas of triangles and parallelograms and the volumes of rectangular and triangular prisms to solve problems.
AC9MAS7B3|B3|They describe the relationships between the radius, diameter and circumference of a circle.
AC9MAS7B4|B4|Students classify polygons according to their features and create an algorithm designed to sort and classify shapes.
AC9MAS7B5|B5|They represent objects two-dimensionally in different ways, describing the usefulness of these representations.
AC9MAS7B6|B6|Students use coordinates to describe transformations of points in the plane.
AC9MAS7C1|C1|They plan and conduct statistical investigations involving discrete and continuous numerical data, using appropriate displays.
AC9MAS7C2|C2|Students interpret data in terms of the shape of distribution and summary statistics, identifying possible outliers.
AC9MAS7C3|C3|They decide which measure of central tendency is most suitable and explain their reasoning.
AC9MAS7C4|C4|Students list sample spaces for single step experiments, assign probabilities to outcomes and predict relative frequencies for related events.
AC9MAS7C5|C5|They conduct repeated single-step chance experiments and run simulations using digital tools, giving reasons for differences between predicted and observed results.
