# Level description: Year 9

In Year 9, learning in Mathematics builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.

Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:
* apply scientific notation in measurement contexts, routinely consider accuracy in measurement and work with absolute, relative and percentage errors in a range of different measurement contexts
* work with the real number line as a geometric model for real numbers that provides a continuous measurement scale; locate different fractions exactly on the common scale of the real number line using scale and similarity, and locate some irrational square roots of natural numbers using Pythagoras’ theorem
* use linear and quadratic functions to model a broad range of phenomena and contexts, make predictions, and represent these using tables, graphs and algebra, including with the use of digital tools
* manipulate algebraic expressions involving variables, exponents, and the expansion and factorisation of simple quadratic expressions using a variety of techniques including tables, diagrams, algorithms and digital tools
* formulate and solve related linear and non-linear equations exactly or approximately using numerical, graphical and algebraic approaches
* solve measurement problems about the surface area and volume of objects and apply formulas to solve problems, calculating these and related dimensions of objects as required
* use similarity, scale, trigonometry, enlargement transformations, the triangle inequality and Pythagoras’ theorem to solve practical problems using given sets of information
* investigate probabilities of compound events from two-step experiments and solve related problems; use a variety of representations such as Venn diagrams, tree diagrams, two way tables and grids to assist in determining the probabilities for these events; design experiments to gather empirical data about relative frequencies and use these to check their reasoning
* compare multiple numerical data subsets in context and analyse their distributions with consideration of symmetry and skew; justify their choice of data representation with respect to data types and context, and critically review the statistical presentation of data and related arguments of others.
