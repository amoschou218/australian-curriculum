# Science as a human endeavour (Years 7 to 10)

In this strand, students learn about the nature of science, including the role of science inquiry in developing science knowledge, and the factors that affect the use and advancement of science. Students learn that through science, humans seek to improve their understanding of and explanations for the natural and physical world, and that science knowledge is refined and revised as new evidence becomes available. They appreciate that science influences society by posing and responding to ethical, environmental and social questions, and individual and collective scientific research is itself influenced by the needs and priorities of society. This strand highlights the development of science as a unique way of knowing and doing, and the role of science in contemporary decision-making and problem-solving.

## Substrands

### Nature and development of science (Years 7 to 10)

Students develop an appreciation of the unique nature of science and scientific knowledge, including that scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence and can be modified in light of new or reinterpreted evidence. They explore historical and global contributions to scientific knowledge and appreciate that individual and collaborative scientific endeavours are influenced by cultural perspectives and world views.

In this sub-strand, students develop the core concepts that:
* science inquiry values curiosity, creativity, accuracy, objectivity, perseverance and scepticism
* science knowledge is a result of individual and collaborative efforts, and advances reflect historical and global contributions
* science knowledge is built on empirical evidence; however, all science knowledge can be changed in light of new or reinterpreted evidence.

### Use and influence of science (Years 7 to 10)

Students explore how scientific knowledge and applications affect individuals and communities, including informing their decisions and identifying responses to contemporary issues. They learn that in making decisions about science practices and applications, ethical, environmental and social implications must be taken into account. Students also gain an appreciation for the ways in which science is influenced by the needs and priorities of society.

In this sub-strand, students develop the core concepts that:
* scientific knowledge, practices and products are influenced by ethical, environmental, social and economic factors
* science, technology and engineering are interconnected; advances in one field can lead to advances in other fields
* science knowledge, balanced with ethical and social considerations, contributes to understanding complex contemporary issues and identifying responses.
